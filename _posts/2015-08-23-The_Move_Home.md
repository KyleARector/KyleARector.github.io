I realize that I haven't written a post in a while, I hope to change that trend very soon. The past few months have been an absolute whirlwind, but things are finally settling down. My fiance and I have moved back to the Indianapolis area, and are extremely glad to be near family and friends in the Mid West. Beyond that, we are planning a wedding here next year, and that would have been an extreme challenge from 700 miles away.
<br/> <br/>
Many many MANY things went into our decision, but chief among them was the fact that we (eventually) would like to raise a family here. The Mid West was excellent for our individual upbringings, and we look forward to our future together here. Savannah was a beautiful city to live in, and the proximity to the beach was wonderful, but in the end, it just was not home. For me, the smaller city was nice for vacationing in, but lacked things I often took for granted in Indianapolis, such as professional sports, concert venues, and, well, a summer that was not debilitatingly hot.
<br/> <br/>
The (potentially) unfortunate part of our move was the change in my employment. I had VERY recently (see previous blog post) changed roles at my last company from a CAD oriented job to a software developer. I was very excited for this change, and the new challenges it would bring. I was very fortunate to find employment in Indianapolis ahead of our move, but my position is back to be CAD-centric. This is not necessarily a problem; I have spent years in CATIA V5, and am extremely comfortable working in it. That being said, at some point I would love to make a return to development. As I mentioned in my last post, the possibilities seem endless, and it is in development that I feel truly challenged to create comprehensive and innovative solutions. 
<br/><br/>
I plan to continue developing my programming skills on the side, and as usual, the projects may have some interaction with CAD software. With any luck, those skills will serve a company very well some day.
<br/><br/>
If anyone is in the Indianapolis area, look us up! We are very happy to be home, and I welcome any advice on life, programming, or wedding planning.
