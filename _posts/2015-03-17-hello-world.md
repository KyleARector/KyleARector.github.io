<p>First official post on my new blog! I hope to use this site to learn, give tips on various CAD or coding issues, and share some of my projects. As I mention on the "About" page, I am a heavy CAD user, with specialties in CATIA V5, Creo 2.0, and NX. In my free time I like to dabble with programming, be it with C# and WPF or C++ and gesture peripheral APIs.<br/>
I would also like to thank my good friends Matt and Libby McCormick. Without them, I would not have: 
<ul>
	<li>Been able to develop my first web site several years ago in HTML and CSS</li>
	<li>Been able to manipulate Jekyll to populate this site (Don't worry, Matt, I am still tweaking the CSS!)</li>
	<li>Made it through college, in general</li>
<ul>
</p>
