<p>First official post on my new blog! I hope to use this site to learn, give tips on various CAD or coding issues, and share some of my projects. As I mention on the "About" page, I am a heavy CAD user, with specialties in CATIA V5, Creo 2.0, and NX. I am also a developer, and like to work with C# and WPF or C++ and gesture peripheral APIs. I occasionally work in VB.NET, but typically prefer C languages, when given the choice.<br/><br/>
I would also like to thank my good friends Matt and Libby McCormick. Without them, I would not have: 
<ul>
	<li>Been able to develop my first web site several years ago in HTML and CSS</li>
	<li>Been able to manipulate Jekyll to populate this site</li>
	<li>Made it through college, in general</li>
<ul>
</p>
