<p>Let me start this post by noting that I have been working in some form of CATIA V5 for nearly 7 years now. This count includes 5 academic years, and 2 professional, as well as all the additional time I have spent fiddling with the CAD package on the side. Until recently, I thought there was very little that the Dassault product could do to surprise me; That is when I discovered the plane problem.
<br/><br/>
The interpretation my colleagues and I share is that this issue was not intended by Dassault, but occurred as a necessity of how the software was written. If it is an intentional feature, I would like to apologize ahead of time.
