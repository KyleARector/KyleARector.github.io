<p>Let me start this post by noting that I have been working in some form of CATIA V5 for nearly 7 years now. This count includes 5 academic years, and 2 professional, as well as all the additional time I have spent fiddling with the CAD package on the side. Until recently, I thought there was very little that the Dassault product could do to surprise me; That is when I discovered the plane problem.
