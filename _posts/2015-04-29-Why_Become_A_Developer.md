Recently, I made the choice to pursue a career in software development. I was fortunate enough to be able to make this transition within my company, and even in my department. While this may not sound like a profound change, given my interests and occasional professional activities, it was actually a huge decision. I came to a junction where I had to decide if I was to stick with my original career plan of mechanical design, or to leave my comfort zone to pursue a passion. 
As with any life change, there were a number of considerations (worries) that I needed to address.
<br/>
<ul>
	<li>Will I have to leave to get a new job?</li>
	<li>Will I be able to do this every day, for X years?</li>
	<li>Do I have good enough reason to do it?</li>
	<li>Do I really even have the chops to do this?</li>
</ul>
<br/>
First, would I need to leave Gulfstream to become a developer, professionally anyway? As I mentioned before, this transition was able to be conducted within my department. I come from an analyst role; I gathered requirements from users, and worked with developers to create and implement the solutions in our CAD software, and occasionally in our PDM. 
While I had joked about my desire to be a professional programmer with my colleagues, I had never seriously posed the idea to my superiors. When it came time for yearly evaluations, I brought it up, and it was fortuitous that I did. We were in dire need of developers, and I was experienced in just the right language. I am unaware if I will be with this employer for my entire career, but I will always be grateful for this opportunity. 
<br/> <br/>
One of the more daunting questions was if I could stand to do this every day, week in, week out, until what is left of my hair turns gray. As any developer can tell you, programming can be frustrating. Sometimes, you are only missing a semi-colon, and other times a colleague accidentally tramples your class structure. Even more frequently, something just will not compile, and you worry that your Voltron-ed together code might actually not be as flawless as it felt leaving your brain through your fingertips. Despite all that frustration, there is something absolutely beautiful about creating an application from nothing, and working in sync with others to create a truly innovative solution. That aspect of creation is what started me in CAD, and it is what helped me refine my career with development.
<br/> <br/>
The next question is probably my favorite to answer, as ridiculous as my answer might seem. Is the reason behind my change good enough? First, let me get into why I enjoy programming so much. Apart from the boundless wealth of tutorials available on the web, and beyond the reports that say that everyone needs to learn to code, the software languages we use are in EVERYTHING. And with them, you can do ANYTHING. 
I love being able to use a microcontroller and some code to actually interact with the real world. Or, using a gesture controller like Leap motion to control something in the digital world. The culmination of that would be using a gesture controller, interpreting the data digitally, and sending commands back out through another microcontroller. Essentially, programming lets me get as close to using magic or having telekinesis as I am going to get. Granted, that is not in my current job description, but it is that passion, combined with the love of creation that gives me a reason to change careers. 
<br/> <br/>
That brings us to the final question. The big one. The one that keeps anxiety ridden twenty-somethings like myself up at night. Can I do this? Am I the right person? Well, yes and no. Even if you do not immediately believe it, you have to tell yourself that. I am certainly not the best developer in the world. Not even close. Take a look at my GitHub page. There may be some gems, but overall, I am still learning. In my new profession, it pays to always be learning. I am surrounded by great resources and friends to help me on this journey, and while I am not completely comfortable yet, I know I can fill the role out well, and keep learning still. Does anyone really fit the complete job description on day one?
<br/> <br/>
TLDR<br/> 
I am a professional developer now. I am still learning the ropes, but I can’t wait to see what the future holds! Ps, someone please teach me ASP, ASAP.
