Recently, I made the choice to pursue a career in software development. I was fortunate enough to be able to make this transition within my company, and even in my department. While this may not sound like a profound change, given my interests and occasional professional activities, it was actually a huge decision. I came to a junction where I had to decide if I was to stick with my original career plan of mechanical design, or to leave my comfort zone to pursue a passion. 
As with any life change, there were a number of considerations (worries) that I needed to address.
