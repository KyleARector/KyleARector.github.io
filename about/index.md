My name is Kyle Rector, and I am a developer and occasional mechanical designer at Gulfstream Aerospace. I graduated from Purdue University in 2013, with a degree in Computer Graphics Technology and a minor in Mechanical Engineering. At work or at home, I have a "maker" mentality; I absolutely love to build innovative solutions, whether in CAD or in code. I am engaged to the love of my life, and together we are raising a mutt named Faye, along with a Roomba we have affectionately dubbed "Chappie."

You can take a look at the code behind some of my projects on <a href="https://www.github.com/kylearector" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, and I recently joined the <a href="http://www.onshape.com/" target="_blank">Onshape</a> community for web-based collaborative CAD.
